# tet-rs

This is another clone of Tetris using [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/). However since this is written in rust I'm using [Wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/) so it's compiled into GLES.

### [Click here](https://ekarademir.com/tet-rs/) to play in the browser,

but you can also clone the repository and run it with

```sh
cargo run
```

(after [installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).)
